# Grade 101/125

This project was a huge step over the previous ones. They calculate 210 hours to do it, as the previous was on a avarege of 70.

Seeing that we should do the same as bash does, IT WAS HARD!!!

The lexer and the parser of bash was a lot difficult to reproduce.

It was the first project that I needed an global variable (to get exit status).

Subject of the project included on repository.
